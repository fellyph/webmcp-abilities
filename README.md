Bridges WordPress Abilities to the WebMCP browser API, making your site's capabilities discoverable by AI agents in compatible browsers.

## Description

**WebMCP Abilities** connects the [WordPress Abilities API](https://developer.wordpress.org/apis/abilities-api/) to the [WebMCP browser standard](https://webmachinelearning.github.io/webmcp/), allowing AI agents in compatible browsers to discover and invoke your site's registered capabilities as structured tools.

Already running in production on [wppopupmaker.com](https://wppopupmaker.com). The WordPress core team is exploring the same direction — see the [WebMCP adapter experiment](https://github.com/WordPress/ai/pull/224).

### How It Works

When enabled, the plugin:

1. Registers a lightweight JavaScript bridge on your site's front end
2. Fetches all registered WordPress Abilities visible to the current user
3. Exposes them to the browser's AI agent via `document.modelContext.registerTool()`
4. Agents can then invoke tools, which execute server-side via a secure REST API

### Built-in Tools

The plugin ships four starter tools that work immediately — no other plugins needed:

* **Search Posts** — Search published posts by keyword (public)
* **Get Post** — Retrieve a post by ID or slug (public)
* **Get Categories** — List all post categories (public)
* **Submit Comment** — Submit a comment on a post (respects WordPress comment settings)

### Related Integrations

* **Complements [WordPress MCP Adapter](https://github.com/WordPress/mcp-adapter)** — which handles CLI and API agents via the MCP protocol. This plugin handles browser-based agents.
* **Complements [wmcp.dev](https://www.wmcp.dev/)** — which handles declarative form annotations. This plugin handles registered Abilities as imperative tools.

### Browser Support

Open your WordPress site in the ChatGPT desktop app's built-in browser to let ChatGPT Work or Codex discover and use its WebMCP tools, using your signed-in WordPress session. Site tools must be enabled and available for your model and workspace. See [ChatGPT's Site tools documentation](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/webmcp) for current availability and setup.

Chrome 146 or higher also supports WebMCP with the testing flag enabled. In browsers without WebMCP support, the plugin loads but silently does nothing — no errors.

### Secure Context Required

The WebMCP standard requires a secure context. The front-end bridge will not load on ordinary HTTP sites. Browsers make an exception for localhost and loopback addresses used for local development, and the plugin supports that exception.

### For Plugin Developers

Any ability registered via `wp_register_ability()` automatically becomes a WebMCP tool, available by default to signed-in users who pass its permission callback. The site admin can adjust visibility in **Settings → WebMCP**. Explicit plugin opt-outs and saved admin visibility choices are respected.

```php
// Register your category first (on the wp_abilities_api_categories_init hook).
add_action( 'wp_abilities_api_categories_init', function () {
    wp_register_ability_category( 'my-plugin', array(
        'label'       => 'My Plugin',
        'description' => 'Tools provided by My Plugin.',
    ) );
} );

// Then register abilities (on the wp_abilities_api_init hook).
add_action( 'wp_abilities_api_init', function () {
    wp_register_ability( 'my-plugin/my-action', array(
        'label'               => 'My Action',
        'description'         => 'Does something useful for agents.',
        'category'            => 'my-plugin',
        'input_schema'        => array( ... ),
        'execute_callback'    => function( $input ) { ... },
        'permission_callback' => function() { return current_user_can( 'read' ); },
        'meta'                => array( 'wmcp_visibility' => 'public' ),
    ) );
} );
```

**Important:** WordPress requires the category to be registered via `wp_register_ability_category()` before any ability can use it. Abilities with unregistered categories are silently dropped by WordPress core. Alternatively, you can use the `'webmcp'` category registered by this plugin.

Visibility options via the `meta` array:

* `'wmcp_visibility' => 'public'` — advertised to logged-out visitors too, if the site allows public discovery
* `'wmcp_visibility' => 'authenticated'` (default) — advertised only to signed-in users
* `'wmcp_visibility' => 'private'` — never advertised, and the admin cannot override it

An ability is advertised as soon as its plugin is active; there is no allowlist to tick. On the **Tools** tab of the settings page the admin can hide any ability with the eye, or tick its box to advertise it to logged-out visitors as well.

## Installation

1. Upload the `webmcp-abilities` folder to `/wp-content/plugins/`
2. Activate the plugin through the **Plugins** screen in WordPress
3. Go to **Settings → WebMCP** to configure tool visibility and public discovery
4. Ensure your production site is served over HTTPS (HTTP loopback URLs also work for local development)

### Requirements

* WordPress 6.9 or higher (requires the Abilities API)
* PHP 8.0 or higher
* A browser with WebMCP support, such as the ChatGPT desktop app's built-in browser or Chrome 146+ with the testing flag enabled

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I need to configure anything?

Activate the plugin and four built-in tools work immediately. Third-party abilities are available by default to signed-in users who pass their permission callbacks. Use Settings → WebMCP to adjust visibility and enable public discovery.

### Is this safe?

Yes. Every tool is advertised to signed-in users only unless it is explicitly marked public, and the admin can hide any tool outright. Each tool's own `permission_callback` enforces WordPress capabilities at execution time.

### Can anonymous visitors use tools?

It depends on the tool. Public tools (like the built-in search and category tools) can be executed by anyone. Write tools and tools with custom permission callbacks may require authentication. A tool a visitor is not shown is also a tool that visitor cannot run.

### Does this work with the WordPress MCP Adapter?

Yes — they are complementary. Built-in tools are registered as real WordPress Abilities, so they also appear via the MCP Adapter for CLI/API agents. The two plugins serve different transports (browser vs. API/CLI).

### What about the `.well-known/webmcp.json` manifest?

This feature (which allows agents to discover tools before visiting the page) is planned for a future release. In the current version, agents discover tools when they load a page on your site.

## Screenshots

1. The WebMCP Abilities settings page — the Tools tab lists every registered ability with an eye to hide it and a checkbox to open it up to logged-out visitors; the Settings tab enables the bridge and controls tool discovery.
